                   They seek in transforming smallholder or lets say small scale farmers into big successful enterprenuers. They do this by increasing their access to information on weather conditions, farm inputs, and resources that increase productivity.

                                    <p>
                                        With the help of numerous <a href="/"><b>Apps</b></a> created by the <a href=""><b>Team</b></a> at Farmerline, they are able to send audios of information on how the weather condition at a particular time is or is going to be. They collect information on farmers including the language they understand to be able to provide the audios in their language. Thats amazing.
